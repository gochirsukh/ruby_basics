## Method Access control

* Methods provide access to instance variables
* Only expose interface when necessary
* Oonly allow access to methods when nessary
* Acess control restricts access to methods from outside an instance

#### Method Access control Differences

* `public`: anyone can access (default)
* `protected`: can only be called by instance of the class and its subclasses 
* `private`: can be only called by instance of a class

#### Example

```
class SomeClass 

    def method1
    end 

protected
    def method2
    end

private
    def method3
    end
end 
```
